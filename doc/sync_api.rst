.. py:currentmodule:: aiohappybase

To maintain complete backwards compatibility with the original HappyBase
and to ease upgrading, this library comes with a synchronous version of the
API that is autogenerated from the async API at import time to ensure
it doesn't diverge.

The library can be accessed one of two ways:

1. Via the ``aiohappybase.sync`` subpackage
2. The ``happybase.py`` module (which simply imports everything from 1)

.. note::
    If you have both HappyBase and AIOHappyBase installed in the same
    environment, HappyBase should be picked when you ``import happybase``
    (packages always seem to be loaded before modules when they have the same
    name) but it isn't advised to have both installed.

    To ensure you always get sync the version of AIOHappyBase, it is best to
    use ``import aiohappybase.sync as happybase`` if you wish to use the
    ``happybase`` name. The module is really only to smooth the transition.
